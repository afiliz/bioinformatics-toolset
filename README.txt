The goal of this project is to develop a lightweight web application that can quickly and efficiently perform bioinformatics-related tasks. This will allow those in bioinformatics-related fields to make quick calculations and obtain results with ease.

The ultimate goal of this project is to make this web application THE place to come to in order to get bioinformatics calculations done quickly, and will eventually include many different functions. For example, at launch the project will include the ability to translate DNA into RNA, count the number of nucleotides in a DNA strand, and find the reverse-complement of a DNA strand.

This project was coded by Adam Filiz and Vincent Wu from January 20th to the 21st, 2018 in a 36-hour hackathon known as CruzHacks.
