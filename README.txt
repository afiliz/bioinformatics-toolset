The goal of this project is to develop a web application that can quickly and efficiently perform genomics-related tasks.

This will allow those in genomics-related fields to make quick calculations and obtain results with ease.

The ultimate goal of this project is to make this web application THE place to do genomics-related functions, but will start off with some simple functions.

This project was coded by Adam Filiz from January 20th to the 21st, 2018 in a 36-hour hackathon known as CruzHacks.
